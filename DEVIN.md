# Matrix — Devin Adapter Notes

Devin CLI is the **only** host Matrix currently runs under. This file documents the Devin-specific binding. The brain itself ([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) + `brain/`) is written to stay CLI-agnostic (so a second adapter would be cheap to add later), but this adapter is the only one implemented and maintained today — this is Layer 3 (the Trainman) for Devin.

## Prime directives

1. **Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first.** It is the document of record for all agent behavior.
2. **The user talks only to Neo.** Specialists are reached through Neo's routing, never directly.
3. **Sacred foundation (Zion) is non-negotiable.** See `AGENTS.md` §4.
4. **State is files.** Managed by `bin/matrix`. Agents never mutate state files by hand.
5. **Reality decides.** Nothing is "done" without an E2E happy-path check (`validate_phase_close`).

## Capability → Devin tool mapping (the Trainman table)

The brain declares abstract capabilities; the Devin adapter binds them:

| Capability | Devin native |
|---|---|
| `read` | read file |
| `edit` | edit / multi-edit |
| `search` | grep / find |
| `code-nav` | semantic search (or fallback to search) |
| `run-subagent` | `run_subagent` |
| `ask-user` | `ask_user_question` |
| `run-command` | `run_command` |
| `browser` | `mcp__chrome-browser__*` (visual QA; no-op if that MCP server isn't configured) |
| `docs-lookup` | `mcp__context7__*` (version-pinned library/framework docs; Oracle) |

Every generated `AGENT.md` also gets a Devin-native `allowed-tools:` grant, resolved from the same `capabilities:` list through a second, smaller map (`allowed_tools:` in `adapters/devin/adapter.yaml`) — see "Least-privilege" in `capability-map.md`. Neo's `SKILL.md` is deliberately left without `allowed-tools` (see below).

The Trainman is a **two-step** flow for Devin:

```bash
bin/matrix build   --target=devin   # 1. generate artifacts → adapters/devin/generated/.agents/
bin/matrix install --target=devin   # 2. deploy them into Devin's global discovery path
```

- **build** renders thin-pointer artifacts from the agnostic `brain/agents/*.md` into `adapters/devin/generated/` (gitignored, ephemeral). Each pointer references the brain by **absolute path** so it resolves from any working directory.
- **install** *copies* those pointers (self-contained, not symlinks) into Devin's global path. Copies survive even if `generated/` is wiped, because they point at the git-tracked brain by absolute path. Re-run both steps after changing an agent's `name`/`description` or the roster.

### Where the artifacts land (global discovery)

| Artifact | Global path | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Neo (master) | `~/.config/devin/skills/neo/SKILL.md` | `/neo` and autonomous invocation in **every** project |
| Specialists | `~/.config/devin/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` | Subagent profiles available in **every** project |

Global install is deliberate: Neo must be reachable from any repo — inside Matrix, inside `clients/`, or an unrelated project. The installer also removes stale, broken Matrix-owned symlinks left by older ad-hoc wiring (it never touches non-Matrix entries).

## Model policy

Every generated `SKILL.md`/`AGENT.md` carries a `model:` frontmatter field, resolved at build time from the agent's `model_policy` tier (`cheap`/`reasoning`/`auto`, declared in `brain/agents/<name>.md`) through `adapters/devin/adapter.yaml`'s `model_policy` map. Re-derived 2026-07-17 from `devin-master-documentation`'s model pages (`docs/22-devin-cli-models-overview.md`, `docs/26-cognition-swe-models.md`), which mirror Devin CLI's own model-selection guidance: "multi-file refactors, architecture changes, deep reasoning" → `opus`/`gpt`; "quick edits, bug fixes, cost-sensitive work" → `swe` (fast); mixed workloads → `adaptive` (Cognition's per-task router):

| Tier | Model | Used by | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cheap` | `swe-1-7-lightning` | Keymaker, Lock | Cerebras-backed fast variant — same intelligence, lower latency, for mechanical/plumbing work |
| `reasoning` | `opus` (Claude Opus 4.8) | Architect, Morpheus, Oracle, Smith | Devin CLI's own guidance names `opus`/`gpt` for deep reasoning/architecture/research/evaluation; SWE-1.7 trails Opus by a few points on FrontierCode/Terminal-Bench/SWE-Bench Multilingual per Cognition's own comparison table. Real cost: $5/$25 per MTok, 1M context. |
| `auto` | `adaptive` | Neo, Trinity | Mixed work (routing + implementation spans trivial to complex); Cognition's own per-task router picks cheap/fast vs. capable per request instead of pinning one model. Intro rate $0.50/$2.00 per MTok at time of writing — re-check after the intro window. |

**Both `swe-1.7` and `swe-1-7` are accepted and normalize to the same canonical id** (confirmed via the sessions database — do not assume dash vs. dot matters). `swe-1-7-lightning` is a genuinely distinct, faster model, not just an alias.

**Time-bound: SWE-1.7 is a free preview only through 2026-08-08; Adaptive's intro pricing window ended 2026-07-07 (may already be standard rate).** Re-verify this table periodically (repeat the `--model X -p "OK"` + sessions.db check, or just watch `/model`'s selector) and update the map if needed. This is exactly the kind of drift this file exists to catch.

To move a tier onto a different model, edit the map in `adapters/devin/adapter.yaml` and rerun:

```bash
bin/matrix build   --target=devin
bin/matrix install --target=devin
```

No agent file needs to change — the tier assignment (which kind of work an agent does) is separate from which model backs that tier.

## External MCP servers this brain assumes

| Server | Scope | Added | Used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chrome-browser` | user (`~/.config/devin/config.json`) | pre-existing | Smith (`browser` capability) |
| `context7` | user (`~/.config/devin/config.json`) | 2026-07-15, `devin mcp add context7 --url https://mcp.context7.com/mcp --scope user` | Oracle (`docs-lookup` capability) |

Both are **user-scope**, so they follow Neo/the specialists globally rather than needing per-project setup. Neither is required for the roster to function — the corresponding capability (`browser`, `docs-lookup`) is simply unavailable if the server isn't configured on a given machine, and the agent should say so rather than fake the check (Foundation 3). context7 works unauthenticated (rate-limited, verified live); running `devin mcp add ...` again prints an OAuth URL for higher rate limits — optional, not required.

## Least-privilege `allowed-tools`

Every specialist's generated `AGENT.md` carries an `allowed-tools:` list, resolved from its `capabilities:` frontmatter through the `allowed_tools:` map in `adapters/devin/adapter.yaml` (categories: `read`, `edit`, `grep`, `glob`, `exec`, plus `mcp__server__tool` patterns — the actual Devin frontmatter vocabulary, distinct from the tool-call names in the `capabilities:` map above). Verified end-to-end: a restricted `keymaker` subagent (only `read`+`exec`) successfully ran `git status`/`git log`; a restricted `smith` subagent (adds `mcp__chrome-browser__*`) successfully read and grepped its own brain file; a restricted `oracle` subagent (adds `mcp__context7__*`) successfully resolved a library id and queried its docs through context7.

Neo's `SKILL.md` is the one exception — deliberately left with no `allowed-tools`. Neo needs `run_subagent` and `ask_user_question`, and neither is a nameable `allowed-tools` entry (see below), so restricting Neo's list to the nameable categories risks silently dropping tools that were never in scope to restrict in the first place. The blast radius of an unrestricted Neo is also lower in practice: it runs in the foreground, user-approved, not as an unattended subagent.

## Subagents can never ask the user directly

Devin withholds `ask_user_question` from every subagent unconditionally — not configurable via `allowed-tools` or `permissions`. Specialists that declare the `ask-user` capability (Architect, Keymaker, Morpheus, Oracle, Trinity) run as Devin subagents, so they cannot call it. When one of them needs a decision from the user, it stops and reports the question back to Neo (the master skill, not a subagent — it keeps `ask_user_question`), which asks and re-delegates. `run_subagent`/`read_subagent` are similarly unavailable inside a subagent by default (nesting is disabled beyond the root agent unless `max-nesting` is set — none of our specialists need it). See `brain/data/capability-map.md` for the full note.

## Mapping to Devin's native structure

- **Master (Neo)** → a Devin Skill (`.agents/skills/neo/SKILL.md`), generated by the adapter, installed globally.
- **Specialists** → Devin Subagents (`.agents/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`), generated by the adapter, installed globally. Neo routes to them via `run_subagent` — including in **Matrix workspace mode**, where Neo delegates real work to specialists and only handles trivial single-step changes itself.
- **Enforcement (Seraph)** → the same portable `hooks/*.py`, invoked via `bin/matrix hooks <name>` or the skill's pre/post steps.

## Session hygiene

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §13. In short: read the contract, know the registry, resolve context, read recent checkpoints + lessons, respect boundaries, never log secrets, checkpoint progress, verify reality before "done".

## Why enforcement is portable, not Devin-coupled

Enforcement lives in `hooks/*.py` with a JSON in/out contract, fired by `bin/matrix hooks <name>`. The logic travels with the brain, not with Devin — so the exact same checks would run unchanged under a future CLI adapter, if one is ever built. The adapter only decides *when* to fire them.
